## Usage

HTTP POST request:

```json
{
  "session_token": "eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiL...",
  "prompt": "Your prompt here"
}
```

Optional:

```json

  "session_token": "eyJhbGciOiJkaXIiL...",
  "prompt": "Your prompt here",
  "conversation_id": "UUID...",
  "parent_id": "UUID..."

- Rate limiting is enabled by default to prevent simultaneous requests

`python3 -m revChatGPT`

```python
from revChatGPT.ChatGPT import Chatbot

chatbot = Chatbot({
  "session_token": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
}, conversation_id=None, parent_id=None) # You can start a custom conversation

response = chatbot.ask("Prompt", conversation_id=None, parent_id=None) # You can specify custom conversation and parent ids. Otherwise it uses the saved conversation (yes. conversations are automatically saved)

print(response)
# {
#   "message": message,
#   "conversation_id": self.conversation_id,
#   "parent_id": self.parent_id,
# }
```
